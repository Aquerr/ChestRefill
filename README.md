# Chest Refill

Chest Refill is a Minecraft plugin for servers which use SpongeForge.

This plugin allows you to create refillable chests, dispensers, droppers and hoppers and regenerate their content after a specified time.

Simply place a e.g. chest, put items in it, mark it as a refillable chest and that's it! You can then update your chest at any time or change how often it should be refilled. :grin:
